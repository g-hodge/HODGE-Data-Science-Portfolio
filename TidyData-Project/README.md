# TidyData-Project
## Summary
In this project, I apply the Tidy Data principles to a dataset containing information on U.S. Federal Research and Development (R&D) budgets from 1976 to 2017. In addition to applying the principles, I create visualizations, pivot tables, and an interactive app. I also provide cleaned versions of the data in both .csv and .xlsx forms.
