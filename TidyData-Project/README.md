# TidyData-Project
## Summary
In this project, I apply the Tidy Data principles to a dataset containing information on U.S. Federal Research and Development (R&D) budgets from 1976 to 2017. In addition to applying the principles, I create visualizations, pivot tables, and an interactive app. I also provide cleaned versions of the data in both .csv and .xlsx forms.

## Data

The data leveraged in this project is a modified version of **jonthegeek**'s [Federal Research and Development Spending by Agency](https://pages.github.com/). Spanning from 1976 to 2017, the modified version contains R&D budget information from across 13 agencies (in addition to another agency containing all other R&D expenditures!). 

After cleaning, the variables included...

``Budget``*: Funds alloted to R&D work in dollars

``Department``: Organizations within the U.S. Federal Government 

``GDP``*: Gross domestic product (GDP) of the U.S. in dollars

``Year``: Fiscal year (runs from Sept. 1st to the following Oct. 31st)

**All dollar amounts have been adjusted for inflation*

## Libraries
To leverage the code, please import the following libraries*:

``pandas``

``seaborn``

``matplotlib.pyplot``

``numpy``

**If you are having issues, it may be necessary to run the command ``!pip install`` followed by the desired library*
